# CSE3302-Homework-2---jmeter-Stress-Test
For this homework assignment, you will pick and run a stress testing tool and report on what you observe from running the stress testing tool on your class project. (Impressions)

Your report should make it as easy as possible to reproduce your results. So your report should carefully document the setup and settings you used in your experiments.

Your report should also describe the problems you observed running the stress testing tool. What did you have to do to fix these problems?

Finally your report should describe anything you learnt about your class project code. Specifically, what kind of problems in your code did the stress testing reveal?

Since different teams develop different kinds of applications in different languages, you may use a different stress testing tool than someone on another team. Following are suggestions but you are free (and encouraged) to use a different stress testing tool. Just document which tool you used.

This is an individual assignment. Each student has to perform this homework by him- or herself.
